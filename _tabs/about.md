Hey my name is Jonas, I am a cybersecurity student and trained software developer, welcome to my security blog!
This blog will be my way of sharing my knowledge and experiences about my experiences, security research and writeups.
I started programming about eleven years ago with PHP. Over the years, I tried out a lot of different languages like Rust, Go, Kotlin and Dart to name a few. But today I mainly work with Python, C/C++, JavaScript and Java.

I did my software engineering apprenticeship where I worked in a team of six developers building a cryptography as a service platform. This project gave me a lot of experience in software development and I learned a lot about cryptography and security. I started to work on my skills in this area and two years ago I decided to study cybersecurity because I am very fascinated by this topic and our local university finally offers a degree in this field. 

In my first year, I was mainly interested in malware analysis and reverse engineering. However, in the last year my interest has shifted more towards penetration testing and exploit development.
I am currently studying and working towards passing the OSCP in the next few months in order to be able to work as a pentester.
